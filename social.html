		<h2>Keeping Data Private</h2>
		<p>
			Internet scammers are always after your private data and information,
			such as your name, date of birth, address, email and more. In the wrong
			hands this data can be very dangerous to you and people you know, as
			this could lead to: phishing, scamming, grooming and stalking. Always
			remember to keep your accounts private, to prevent the leakage of this
			data. On public accounts, never post any personal information such as
			your address. Also, try not to post any pictures with your school
			uniform on, as this could alert potential stalkers to your location.
		</p>
		<h2>Understanding the Risks</h2>
		<p>
			Always remember that all internet activity, especially social media
			carries its risks. When you post something on social media, it is no
			longer your property. Never post anything that you would not feel
			comfortable if it was shared.
		</p>
		<h2>Staying Safe</h2>
		<p>
			There are many strategies you can use to stay safe online, and they can
			be as simple as checking the website or email is legitimate, setting up
			a firewall to block illicit websites, or update your antivirus to
			prevent malware (malicious software). Learn to recognize the signs of
			grooming, (blackmail, secretive conversations, images of a sexual
			nature), and donâ€™t add any suspicious or strange accounts that want to
			be associated with you.
